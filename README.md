# NeuralProphet
Code for predicting weather using neural network algorithm (called Neural Prophet)...Machine Learning.
 A Neural Network based Time-Series model, inspired by Facebook Prophet and AR-Net, built on PyTorch
    Documentation: https://neuralprophet.com/html/index.html
 
 Also, the code to save this model to a file (persist) using pickle library is included (and how to re-read the saved the model for further modeling).
